## Binomial
How many success outcomes in n tries with probability p of a single success?    
In this case we have 6 success outcomes in 10 tries and we are attempting to understand the likelihood of each choice of the parameter p. Shockingly, 0.6 is looking pretty good...
```{r, echo=FALSE}
probabilities <- seq(0.0, 1.0, 0.025)
likelihood <- dbinom(6,10, probabilities) 
likelihood <- likelihood / sum(likelihood)
plot(probabilities, likelihood, main = "Likelihood of Parameter p for 6 successes in 10 tries")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
successes <- seq(0, 10)
p_successes <- dbinom(successes,10, 0.6) 
p_successes <- p_successes / sum(p_successes)
plot(successes, p_successes, main = "Probability of number of successes in 10 tries at p=0.6")
```
