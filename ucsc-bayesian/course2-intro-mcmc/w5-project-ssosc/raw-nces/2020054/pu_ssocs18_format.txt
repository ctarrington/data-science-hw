****PURPOSE:
	This file reads in the 2018 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS:2018)
	unformatted SAS dataset and adds value labels.

****A NOTE OF CAUTION:
	The code that follows assumes that the SSOCS:2018 file has been copied
	onto your hard drive into the C:\SSOCS18 directory. If this is not the
	case, you must change C:\SSOCS18 in the libname statements below to the path in
	which the pu_ssocs18.sas7bdat file is located.
