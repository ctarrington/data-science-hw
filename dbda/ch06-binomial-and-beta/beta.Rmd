This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

## beta distribution
$$
beta(\alpha, \beta) = \frac {p^{\alpha-1} (1-p)^{\beta-1}} {beta\ function}
\ where\ beta\ function = 
\int_0^1 p^{\alpha-1} (1-p)^{\beta-1} dp
$$
The beta function normalizes the curve so it can serve as a PDF.

```{r}
curve(dbeta(x, 10, 10), col = "blue", xlab = "trial probabbility", ylab = "Density", xlim=c(0.1,0.9), ylim=c(0,5))
